How To Install Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack On CentOS 6

Step 1
—Install Apache
Apache is a free open source software which runs over 50% of the world’s web servers.

To install apache, open terminal and type in this command:

#sudo yum install httpd

Once it installs, you can start apache running on your VPS:

# sudo service httpd start

That’s it. To check if Apache is installed, direct your browser to your server’s IP address (eg. http://12.34.56.789). The page should display the words “It works!" like this.
How to find your Server’s IP address

You can run the following command to reveal your server’s IP address.

# ifconfig eth0 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2 }'

Step 2
—Install MySQL
MySQL is a powerful database management system used for organizing and retrieving data on a virtual server

To install MySQL, open terminal and type in these commands:

#sudo yum install mysql-server
#sudo service mysqld start

During the installation, MySQL will ask you for your permission twice. After you say Yes to both, MySQL will install.

Once it is done installing, you can set a root MySQL password:

#sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

The prompt will ask you for your current root password.

Since you just installed MySQL, you most likely won’t have one, so leave it blank by pressing enter.

Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Then the prompt will ask you if you want to set a root password. Go ahead and choose Y and follow the instructions.

CentOS automates the process of setting up MySQL, asking you a series of yes or no questions.

It’s easiest just to say Yes to all the options. At the end, MySQL will reload and implement the new changes.

By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y                                            
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
... Success!

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

Cleaning up...

All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MySQL
installation should now be secure.

Step 3
— Install PHP

PHP is an open source web scripting language that is widely used to build dynamic webpages.

To install PHP on your virtual private server, open terminal and type in this command:

#sudo yum install php php-mysql

Once you answer yes to the PHP prompt, PHP will be installed.
#PHP Modules

PHP also has a variety of useful libraries and modules that you can add onto your server. 
You can see the libraries that are available by typing:

#yum search php-

Terminal then will display the list of possible modules. The beginning looks like this:

php-bcmath.x86_64 : A module for PHP applications for using the bcmath library
php-cli.x86_64 : Command-line interface for PHP
php-common.x86_64 : Common files for PHP
php-dba.x86_64 : A database abstraction layer module for PHP applications
php-devel.x86_64 : Files needed for building PHP extensions
php-embedded.x86_64 : PHP library for embedding in applications
php-enchant.x86_64 : Human Language and Character Encoding Support
php-gd.x86_64 : A module for PHP applications for using the gd graphics library
php-imap.x86_64 : A module for PHP applications that use IMAP

To see more details about what each module does, type the following command into terminal, replacing the name of the module with whatever library you want to learn about.

#yum info <name of the module>

Once you decide to install the module, type:

#sudo yum install <name of the module>

We should also set the processes to run automatically when the server boots (php will run automatically once Apache starts):

#sudo chkconfig httpd on
#sudo chkconfig mysqld on

Step 4
RESULTS: See PHP on your Server

Although LAMP is installed on your virtual server, we can still take a look and see the 
components online by creating a quick php info page

To set this up, first create a new file:

#sudo nano /var/www/html/info.php

Add in the following line:

<?php
phpinfo();
?>

:wq

# sudo service httpd restart
